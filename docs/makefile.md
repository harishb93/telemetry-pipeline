## Primary Targets

### Build Targets

#### `make build`
Builds all Go binaries and React dashboard.

```bash
make build
# Output:
# bin/telemetry-streamer
# bin/telemetry-collector
# bin/api-gateway
# bin/mq-service
# dashboard/dist/ (React build)
```

**Individual build targets**:
```bash
make build-collector  # Build collector only

```

#### `make test`
Runs all Go tests with atomic coverage reporting, excluding system tests.

```bash
make test
# Output: coverage.out
# Shows: tests run, passed, failed
# Excludes: system test suite (tagged with "system")
```

#### `make system-tests`
Runs comprehensive end-to-end system tests.

```bash
make system-tests
# Runs: Full system integration tests
# Duration: ~10 minutes
# Requires: All binaries built
```

#### `make system-tests-quick`
Runs quick functional system tests.

```bash
make system-tests-quick  
# Runs: Essential system tests only
# Duration: ~5 minutes
# Good for: Development iteration
```

#### `make system-tests-performance`

```bash
make system-tests-performance
# Runs: Load and performance tests
# Duration: ~15 minutes  
# Tests: Throughput, latency, resource usage
```

#### `make coverage`
Generates HTML coverage report.

```bash
make coverage
# Output: coverage.html (open in browser)
# Shows: coverage percentage per package
```

### Docker Targets

#### `make docker-build`
Builds Docker images using multi-stage builds.

```bash
# Build with default tag
make docker-build
# Creates: telemetry-streamer:latest, telemetry-collector:latest, etc.

# Build with custom tag and registry
make docker-build TAG=v1.0.0 REGISTRY=gcr.io/my-project
# Creates: gcr.io/my-project/telemetry-streamer:v1.0.0, etc.
```

**Images created**:
- `mq-service:TAG`
- `telemetry-streamer:TAG`
- `telemetry-collector:TAG`
- `api-gateway:TAG`
- `dashboard:TAG` (React frontend)

**Registry tagging**: All images are automatically tagged for the specified registry.

**Entrypoint scripts**: Automatically makes all entrypoint scripts executable before building.

#### `make docker-push`
Pushes Docker images to registry.

```bash
# Push to default registry
make docker-push
# Pushes to localhost:5000

# Push to custom registry
make docker-push REGISTRY=gcr.io/my-project TAG=v1.0.0
# Pushes to gcr.io/my-project
```

**Pushes all 5 images** including the new dashboard image.

#### `make docker-build-and-push`
Uses the `deploy/docker/build-and-push.sh` script for building and pushing.

```bash
make docker-build-and-push TAG=v1.0.0
# Runs the build-and-push.sh script with specified tag
# Includes registry startup, health checks, and verification
```

### Helm Targets

#### `make helm-install`
Deploys the pipeline to Kubernetes using individual Helm charts (like quickstart.sh).

```bash
# Deploy with default settings
make helm-install
# Deploys to gpu-telemetry namespace using individual charts

# Deploy with custom tag and registry
make helm-install TAG=v1.0.0 REGISTRY=gcr.io/my-project
```

**Installation order**:
1. `shared-resources` (creates namespace)
2. `mq-service` (waits for ready)
3. `telemetry-collector` (waits for ready)
4. `api-gateway` (waits for available)
5. `dashboard` (waits for available)
6. `telemetry-streamer` (DaemonSet)

**Creates**:
- Kubernetes namespace `gpu-telemetry`
- Individual Helm releases for each component
- StatefulSets (mq-service, collector)
- Deployments (api-gateway, dashboard)
- DaemonSet (telemetry-streamer)
- Services and ConfigMaps

#### `make helm-uninstall`

```bash
make helm-uninstall
# Removes all 5 individual releases:
# - telemetry-streamer
# - dashboard  
# - api-gateway
# - telemetry-collector
# - mq-service
# - shared-resources
```

#### `make helm-status`
Shows deployment status and pod information.

# Detects common issues
# Reports problems
```

#### `make openapi-gen`
Generates OpenAPI/Swagger documentation using swag tool.

```bash
make openapi-gen
# Installs swag if not present
# Creates:
# - api/swagger.json
# - api/swagger.yaml
# - api/docs.go (embedded)
# Also references: api/openapi.yaml (manual spec)
```

#### `make docs` 
Alias for `openapi-gen` for convenience.

```bash
make docs
# Same as make openapi-gen
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures

```bash
# Full clean rebuild
make clean
make deps
make build

# Run different test suites
make test                     # Unit tests only
make test-integration        # Integration tests
make system-tests-quick      # Quick system tests  
make system-tests           # Full system tests

# Check specific package
go test ./internal/mq -v

# Debug system tests
cd tests && go test -v -timeout=10m -tags=system -run="TestSystem" ./...
```

### Test Failures

```bash
# Run single package tests
go test ./internal/mq -v

# Run specific test
go test -run TestPublish ./internal/mq -v

# With timeout
go test -timeout 30s ./...
```

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Registry not running
make registry-start
make registry-status

# Docker Compose issues  
make docker-status       # Check service status
make docker-health-check # Check service health endpoints
make docker-logs         # View logs
make docker-down         # Clean stop
make docker-up           # Restart with full setup

# Try different Docker approaches
make docker-setup        # Use setup.sh script
make docker-setup-build  # Use setup.sh with build
make docker-build-and-push # Use build-and-push.sh script

# Image build failed (check dashboard build)
make build-dashboard     # Test React build separately
docker build -t test -f deploy/docker/dashboard.Dockerfile .

# Check images
docker images | grep telemetry
docker image inspect dashboard:latest  # Check dashboard image

# Clean Docker state
make clean-docker
make docker-setup-down   # Full teardown with script
```

### Kubernetes Issues

```bash
# Use quickstart for comprehensive status
make helm-quickstart-status

# Check pod status (gpu-telemetry namespace)
kubectl get pods -n gpu-telemetry
make helm-status

# View component logs
make helm-quickstart-logs        # All components
kubectl logs -n gpu-telemetry -l app.kubernetes.io/name=collector -f
kubectl logs -n gpu-telemetry -l app.kubernetes.io/name=dashboard -f

# Debug individual pods
kubectl describe pod -n gpu-telemetry <pod-name>

# Test connectivity
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n gpu-telemetry -- curl http://api-gateway:8081/health

# Port forwarding issues
pkill -f "kubectl port-forward"  # Kill existing
make helm-port-forward           # Restart

# Complete reset
make helm-quickstart-down        # Full cleanup
make helm-quickstart TAG=latest  # Fresh setup

# Registry issues in Kind
make registry-status
docker exec kind-registry cat /etc/containerd/certs.d/localhost:5000/hosts.toml
```

---

## Performance Tips

### Faster Builds

```bash
# Use make parallelism
make -j4 all

# Skip tests for faster iteration during development
make build

# Only test changed packages
go test ./internal/mq -v
```

### Smaller Docker Images

```bash
# Multi-stage builds already used
# Check image sizes
docker images | grep telemetry

# Reduce further with Alpine base images
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Increase timeout for slow clusters
make helm-install HELM_NAMESPACE=production --timeout=600s

# Check what will be deployed
helm template telemetry-pipeline ./deploy/helm/charts
```
